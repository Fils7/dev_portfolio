## Overview

Led the development of Cicero Network, a sophisticated DeFi protocol implementing a multi-tranche lending system with proxy pool architecture. The protocol features distinct tranches for different risk appetites and an insurance mechanism for enhanced security.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**
- **OpenZeppelin**
- **Hardhat**
- **Ethers.js**
- **TypeScript**

## Key Features

- **Proxy Pool Architecture**: Designed and implemented a main proxy contract managing three specialized child contracts: Senior Tranche, Junior Tranche, and Insurance Pool, enabling efficient risk segmentation and capital allocation.
- **Multi-Token Ecosystem**: Developed multiple ERC-20 tokens including:
  - Cicero Token: Protocol's native utility token
  - Atticus Token: Governance token for protocol decision-making
- **Vault System**: Implemented a secure vault contract managing asset deposits, withdrawals, and yield distribution across different tranches.
- **Risk Management**: Created a tiered risk management system through the tranche structure, allowing users to choose their preferred risk-reward profile.

## Challenges and Learnings

As my first experience leading a smart contract implementation, this project presented significant learning opportunities and challenges. The complexity of breaking down protocol specifications into manageable components required careful project management and strategic planning. Creating comprehensive technical documentation proved crucial, as it helped maintain clarity throughout the development process and ensured all team members understood the implementation details.

One of the most challenging aspects was designing the architecture for contract interactions. This demanded meticulous attention to security considerations, particularly in managing fund flows and yield distribution across the protocol. Implementing the proxy pattern brought its own set of challenges, especially in handling state management and planning upgrade paths that wouldn't disrupt existing protocol operations.

## Outcome

Working on this protocol was particularly rewarding as it combined my technical interests in blockchain development with the opportunity to contribute to a DeFi project focused on permissionless lending and financial inclusion. The experience of leading the smart contract implementation from initial specification through to audit preparation not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced my commitment to building decentralized financial solutions that can make a meaningful impact in the space.
