## Overview

Led the development of Cicero Network, a sophisticated DeFi protocol implementing a multi-tranche lending system with proxy pool architecture. The protocol features distinct tranches for different risk appetites and an insurance mechanism for enhanced security.

## Key Features

- **Proxy Pool Architecture**: Designed and implemented a main proxy contract managing three specialized child contracts: Senior Tranche, Junior Tranche, and Insurance Pool, enabling efficient risk segmentation and capital allocation.
- **Multi-Token Ecosystem**: Developed multiple ERC-20 tokens including:
  - Cicero Token: Protocol's native utility token
  - Atticus Token: Governance token for protocol decision-making
- **Vault System**: Implemented a secure vault contract managing asset deposits, withdrawals, and yield distribution across different tranches.
- **Risk Management**: Created a tiered risk management system through the tranche structure, allowing users to choose their preferred risk-reward profile.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Primary language for smart contract development
- **OpenZeppelin**: For secure, standard contract implementations
- **Hardhat**: Development environment and testing framework
- **Ethers.js**: For contract interactions and testing
- **TypeScript**: For testing and deployment scripts

As my first experience leading a smart contract implementation, this project presented multiple learning opportunities. Key challenges included:

- **Project Management**: Breaking down complex protocol specifications into manageable sub-tasks and creating clear implementation goals
- **Technical Documentation**: Developing comprehensive documentation from initial specifications through to technical implementation details
- **Architecture Design**: Designing the interaction flow between multiple contracts while ensuring secure fund management and proper yield distribution
- **Smart Contract Development**: Implementing the proxy pattern with careful consideration of upgrade paths and state management
- **Testing Strategy**: Creating extensive test scenarios to ensure protocol stability and security across all components

## Outcome

Working on this protocol was particularly rewarding as it combined my technical interests in blockchain development with the opportunity to contribute to a DeFi project focused on permissionless lending and financial inclusion. The experience of leading the smart contract implementation from initial specification through to audit preparation not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced my commitment to building decentralized financial solutions that can make a meaningful impact in the space.
